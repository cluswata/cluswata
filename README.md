- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve had the privilege of visiting over 21 countries across five continents, and my favorite cities are Cape Town and Tokyo. When I turn 50, I plan to explore my sixth continent, Australia, aiming to run a full marathon along its stunning coast. It’s been an incredible journey, filled with diverse experiences and unforgettable moments.
